# TITLE
    Calories calculator

## Project description
    The benefit for the user of using this site is to get suggestions of what workout to do depending on how many calories
    are desired to burn and the amount of time desired to spend on the workout. 
    The idea is also to suggest places where outdoor workouts can be done, this to relate to the situation of covid19.
    The calories calculator simplifies the search for workouts depending on the level of effort one wants to put it.

### Deployment Details


### Testing
##### Known issues 
    - The amount of time in function "time" is not showing instantly.
    - The classes of <b>suggestions</b> doesn't replace eachother but stays on screen even after you alter value for inputs of time and calories
    so they become double. The change is then that suggestions that are not accurate to current values from time and calories and displaying.
    - The values from Persona-details inputs like "weight", "height" and "BMR" are not taken into account. This is due to lack of time.


### Pending features
 <b>Personal information</b> will be taken into account for showing how many calories user is approximately burning.

 <b>The "BMR" input</b> will be exchanged to "Age" and also a "Gender" input will be applied, this is as I have learnt that
 BMR can be calculated from the other values.

 <b>The calculation</b> will be more accurate and also show how many calories each suggested workout approximately burns.
 Also it will include for how long BMR is increased from each workout.
 There will be more suggestions and also I will try to make them more dynamic – in contrast to the concrete suggestions that
 are now pre-written.
